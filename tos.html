            <h2>4. Payment &amp; Billing</h2>
            <p>Ownly is a paid service. By subscribing to a plan, you agree to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All prices are displayed inclusive of VAT where applicable.</li>

                <li>Payment is due at the beginning of each billing cycle.</li>
                <li>We may change pricing with at least 30 days' prior notice. Price changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle after the notice period.</li>

            <h2>5. Right of Withdrawal (Widerrufsrecht)</h2>
            <p>If you are a consumer within the European Union, you have a statutory right to withdraw from a distance contract within 14 days of its conclusion, without giving any reason.</p>

            <p><strong>Exception for digital services:</strong> If you expressly consent to the commencement of the service before the withdrawal period has expired and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal, the right of withdrawal ceases once the service has begun. We will ask for this consent during the sign-up process.</p>

            <p>We do not warrant that third-party applications deployed through the platform will be free of defects, compatible with your use case, or continuously available.</p>

            <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Our liability is governed by the following rules, in compliance with German law:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unlimited liability:</strong> We are fully liable for damages caused by intent (Vorsatz), gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit), and for injury to life, body, or health, as well as under mandatory statutory provisions (e.g., the Product Liability Act).</li>
                <li><strong>Material obligations (Kardinalpflichten):</strong> In cases of slight negligence (leichte Fahrlässigkeit) breaching a material contractual obligation — i.e., an obligation whose fulfilment is essential for the proper performance of the contract and on whose compliance the customer regularly relies — our liability is limited to the foreseeable, contract-typical damages.</li>
                <li><strong>Other cases:</strong> Liability for slight negligence in breaching non-material obligations is excluded.</li>
