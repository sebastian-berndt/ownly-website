            <p>These Terms govern your use of the Ownly website, platform, and all related services.</p>

            <h2>2. Account Terms</h2>
            <p>To use Ownly you must create an account. By registering, you agree that:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

            <h2>3. Service Description</h2>
            <p>Ownly provides the following services:</p>
            <ul>

            <p>The specific features available to you depend on your chosen plan.</p>

            <h2>4. Payment &amp; Billing</h2>
            <p>Ownly is a paid service. By subscribing to a plan, you agree to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All prices are displayed inclusive of VAT where applicable.</li>
                <li>Billing occurs on a recurring basis (monthly or annually) depending on the plan you choose.</li>
                <li>Payment is due at the beginning of each billing cycle.</li>
                <li>We may change pricing with at least 30 days' prior notice. Price changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle after the notice period.</li>
                <li>If payment fails, we may suspend your services after reasonable notice and a grace period.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Infrastructure costs charged by third-party providers (e.g., server hosting fees) are billed separately where applicable and subject to those providers' own terms.</p>

            <h2>5. Right of Withdrawal (Widerrufsrecht)</h2>
            <p>If you are a consumer within the European Union, you have a statutory right to withdraw from a distance contract within 14 days of its conclusion, without giving any reason.</p>
            <p>To exercise this right, you must inform us of your decision by a clear statement (e.g., email). You can find our contact details in the <a href="imprint.html">Imprint</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Exception for digital services:</strong> If you expressly consent to the commencement of the service before the withdrawal period has expired and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal, the right of withdrawal ceases once the service has begun. We will ask for this consent during the sign-up process.</p>

            <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2>10. Termination</h2>

                <li><strong>By Ownly:</strong> We may terminate or suspend your account for violation of these Terms with reasonable notice, or immediately in cases of severe violations (e.g., illegal activity, security threats).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Upon termination, you will have 30 days to export your data (see Section 7). After this period, all data associated with your account will be permanently deleted.</p>

            <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All content on the Ownly website and platform — including text, design, graphics, logos, and proprietary code — is the property of Ownly or its licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>
            <p>Open-source applications available through the platform are licensed under their respective open-source licenses. Ownly does not claim ownership of these applications. Their original authors and contributors retain all rights as defined by their licenses.</p>

            <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>To the extent permitted by German law:</p>

                <li>For paid services, statutory warranty rights under the German Civil Code (BGB) apply and remain unaffected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not warrant that third-party applications deployed through the platform will be free of defects, compatible with your use case, or continuously available.</p>

            <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Our liability is governed by the following rules, in compliance with German law:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unlimited liability:</strong> We are fully liable for damages caused by intent (Vorsatz), gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit), and for injury to life, body, or health, as well as under mandatory statutory provisions (e.g., the Product Liability Act).</li>
                <li><strong>Material obligations (Kardinalpflichten):</strong> In cases of slight negligence (leichte Fahrlässigkeit) breaching a material contractual obligation — i.e., an obligation whose fulfilment is essential for the proper performance of the contract and on whose compliance the customer regularly relies — our liability is limited to the foreseeable, contract-typical damages.</li>
                <li><strong>Other cases:</strong> Liability for slight negligence in breaching non-material obligations is excluded.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>14. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>

            <p>If you are a consumer within the EU, you retain the right to bring proceedings in the courts of your place of residence. Mandatory consumer protection provisions of your country of residence remain unaffected.</p>

            <h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>

            <p>In accordance with § 36 of the German Consumer Dispute Resolution Act (VSBG), we declare that we are neither obligated nor willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.</p>

            <h2>16. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For material changes, we will provide at least 30 days' advance notice via email or through the platform.</p>
            <p>If you continue to use the platform after the changes take effect, you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you may cancel your account before the changes become effective.</p>
